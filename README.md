# SMTP/IMAP Configuration

This repository hosts the configuration of my &mdash; now decomissioned &mdash; mailserver. It ran as a very simple
stack of [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/), [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/), and
[OpenDKIM](http://www.opendkim.org/), on Arch Linux (up-to-date as of 2021-02-08). I hope this can be of use to someone
out there!
